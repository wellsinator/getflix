# Getflix #
Getflix allows consumers of streaming media to use a federated search for content across multiple content providers.

## Summary ##
Getflix provides a cross-provider search along with a personalized watchlist, movie info and reviews, and suggestions for related titles.

## Problem ##
It is a hassle to search each content-provider individually for a specific movie or tv show.

## Solution ##
Getflix is able to search all providers for the content you're looking for and present it in a no-frills, easy to understand user interface. You can tell Getflix to return all search results, or limit them to only the providers you subscribe to.
